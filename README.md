CYDtemperature
==============
This project is using the famous CYD (Cheap Yellow Display) to show a graph of the last 24 hours outside temperature.

Disclaimer:

This is a clone of a project on Facebook's Home Assistant group

The project was creating a history sensor in HASSIO which seems to have been "disabled" in the latest release. I therefore made the history data inside the ESPHome yaml-file.
